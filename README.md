# Remote Sensing

Welcome to the Remote Sensing Toolbox! This repository provides tools and modules for working with remote sensing data.

## Spectral Indices Module

### Overview

The `SpectralIndices` module within this repository offers a collection of methods for computing various spectral indices commonly used in remote sensing applications. The module is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different datasets.

### Available Spectral Indices

- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)
- NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)
- SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- MSI (Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- CIgreen (Green Chromatic Index)
- NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-Up Index)

### Getting Started

To use the `SpectralIndices` module, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Remote-Sensing.git
   ```

2. Import the `SpectralIndices` class into your Python script or notebook:

   ```python
   from spectral_indices import SpectralIndices
   ```

3. Create an instance of the `SpectralIndices` class and compute the desired indices:

   ```python
   spectral_indices_calculator = SpectralIndices(your_spectral_data)
   ndvi_result = spectral_indices_calculator.ndvi()
   evi_result = spectral_indices_calculator.evi()
   # Add more as needed...
   ```

### Future Developments

Stay tuned for additional modules and files to be developed in this repository, addressing various aspects of remote sensing data analysis. We are continuously working on enhancing the functionality and providing more tools to make your remote sensing projects easier and more efficient.
